This project uses well documented geometrical functions to evaluate congruence between tracks (=MST) and therefore perform a Panbiogeographical analysis. Although the origin is Panbiogeography, the program could be used to evaluate common patterns as Areas of Endemism or Design of Conservation reserves or Primary Homology (in a biogeographical context).

The program is distributed as win(32+64bits)/linux(64bits) binaries, or as a source code to be compiled using [FreePascal](http://www.freepascal.org/).

The paper describing the algorithm could be found at [PlosONE](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0018460)

To download the code you must use [mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/QuickStart). Last revision is martitracks5a1

hg clone https://martitracks.googlecode.com/hg/ martitracks

We are starting a fork to recode MartiTracks in R as MaRtiGoesR. Some functions will be published soon!!!
